- Note: Workbook and Sheet classes are not Sendable due to mutable state requirements
- Use modern Swift idioms and features
- Avoid force-unwraps and force-casts in public APIs

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Use platform-specific conditionals (`#if os(macOS)`, `#if os(iOS)`) for platform-specific APIs
- Avoid iOS-unavailable APIs like `FileManager.default.homeDirectoryForCurrentUser`
- Test builds on both macOS and iOS platforms
- Ensure all file operations work on both platforms
- Use `FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory` for cross-platform file operations

### Code Style & Formatting
- Use 4-space indentation (no tabs)
- Use trailing commas for better git diffs
- Group and reorder imports alphabetically
- Use MARK comments for code organization
- Follow the .swift-format configuration

### File Structure Standards
```swift
//
//  Filename.swift
//  XLKit • https://github.com/TheAcharya/XLKit
//  © 2025 Vigneswaran Rajkumar • Licensed under MIT License

### Test Patterns
```swift
func testFeatureName() {
    // Arrange
    let workbook = Workbook()
    
    // Act
    let result = workbook.someOperation()
    
    // Assert
    XCTAssertEqual(result, expectedValue)
}

func testFeatureNameWithInvalidInput() {
    // Act & Assert
    XCTAssertThrowsError(try someOperation(invalidInput)) { error in
        XCTAssertEqual(error as? XLKitError, .expectedError)
    }
}
```

## Architecture Update (2025-07-07)
- The XLSX engine now generates all required files for Excel compliance, including docProps, theme, styles, sharedStrings, and all relationship files.
- Worksheet, styles, and workbook XML are generated in a single-line, Excel-compliant format.
- The test runner (`XLKitTestRunner`) now includes automated validation using [CoreXLSX](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CoreXLSX) to ensure every generated file is fully compliant and readable by Excel and third-party tools.

## Compliance & Validation
- Every generated Excel file must be validated for structure and content using CoreXLSX.
- Validation checks include: workbook, worksheet, shared strings, styles, and row/cell integrity.
- The test runner must fail if the generated file is not fully compliant.

## Developer Workflow
- To add new Excel features, update the engine and add/extend validation in the test runner.
- Use the test runner to ensure all changes remain Excel-compliant.
- Manual unpacking and inspection of .xlsx files is no longer required for compliance.

## Image Embedding Implementation (2025-07-07) - PERFECT ASPECT RATIO PRESERVATION

### Overview
XLKit now supports pixel-perfect image embedding with automatic sizing and perfect aspect ratio preservation, matching Excel's manual behavior and professional quality exports.

Supported Aspect Ratios (Tested & Validated):
- 16:9 (HD/4K video)
- 1:1 (Square format)
- 9:16 (Vertical video)
- 21:9 (Ultra-wide)
- 3:4 (Portrait)
- 2.39:1 (Cinemascope/Anamorphic)
- 1.85:1 (Academy ratio)
- 4:3 (Classic TV/monitor)
- 18:9 (Modern mobile)
- 1.19:1 (HD Standard)
- 1.5:1 (SD Academy)
- 1.48:1 (SD Academy Alt)
- 1.25:1 (SD Standard)
- 1.9:1 (IMAX Digital)
- 1.32:1 (DCI Standard)
- 2.37:1 (5K Cinema Scope)
- 1.37:1 (IMAX Film 15/70mm)

All aspect ratios are preserved with pixel-perfect accuracy using empirically derived Excel formulas. See Tests/README.md for details and validation results.

### Scaling API (2025-07-12)
XLKit provides automatic image scaling with configurable size control through the `embedImageAutoSized` method.

#### Default Parameters
- `maxCellWidth: 600` - Default maximum width in pixels
- `maxCellHeight: 400` - Default maximum height in pixels
- `scale: 0.5` - Default 50% scaling for compact images

#### Scale Control Options
- `scale: 0.3` - 30% (very small images)
- `scale: 0.5` - 50% (default, compact)
- `scale: 0.7` - 70% (medium size)
- `scale: 0.8` - 80% (larger images)
- `scale: 1.0` - 100% (full size, maximum bounds)

#### Integration Best Practices
- Let XLKit handle all sizing automatically using defaults
- Call `embedImageAutoSized` after column width adjustments
- XLKit will override image column with perfect sizing
- Use `scale` parameter to control image size when needed
- Avoid manual column width calculations for image columns

### Key Features

Perfect Aspect Ratio Preservation
- Images maintain their exact original proportions regardless of cell dimensions
- Zero stretching, squashing, or distortion - pixel-perfect preservation
- Uses empirically derived formulas from manual Excel file analysis
- Supports all 17 professional video and cinema aspect ratios: 16:9, 1:1, 9:16, 21:9, 3:4, 2.39:1, 1.85:1, 4:3, 18:9, 1.19:1, 1.5:1, 1.48:1, 1.25:1, 1.9:1, 1.32:1, 2.37:1, 1.37:1, and any custom ratio

Super-Precise Cell Sizing
- Row height automatically adjusts to match image height using correct formulas
- Column width automatically adjusts to match image width using correct formulas
- Cells perfectly fit the embedded images with no overflow or underflow

Precise Positioning
- Images are positioned exactly at cell boundaries with perfect alignment
- Uses EMU (English Metric Units) for Excel's internal coordinate system
- Zero offsets that could cause misalignment or stretching

Excel Compliance
- Uses correct Excel formulas derived from manual file analysis
- Generates proper drawing XML with accurate EMU coordinates
- Maintains compatibility with all Excel versions
- Passes CoreXLSX validation for full compliance

### API Requirements

Simplified Methods
```swift
// Sheet extension method - auto-sizing with perfect aspect ratio
sheet.embedImageAutoSized(
    imageData,
    at: coordinate,
    of: workbook
) -> Bool

// XLKit convenience method
XLKit.embedImage(
    imageData,
    at: coordinate,
    in: sheet,
    of: workbook,
    scale: 1.0,
    maxWidth: 600,
    maxHeight: 400
) -> Bool
```

Workbook Registration
- Images are automatically registered with both sheet and workbook
- Ensures proper tracking and counting
- Prevents issues with image enumeration

Correct Cell Sizing Formulas
- Column width: `pixels / 8.0` (empirically derived from manual Excel files)
- Row height: `pixels / 1.33` (empirically derived from manual Excel files)
- EMU conversion: `pixels * 9525` (Excel's internal format)
- Maintains perfect aspect ratio preservation for all image types

Critical Implementation Rules
- MANDATORY: Use `ImageSizingUtils` for all sizing calculations
- MANDATORY: Use calculated values, never hardcoded dimensions
- MANDATORY: `rowOff = 0` in drawing XML to keep images within cell boundaries
- MANDATORY: Images must be positioned exactly at cell start point with no offsets
- MANDATORY: All aspect ratios must be preserved exactly - no exceptions

### Implementation Standards

ImageSizingUtils Integration
